# building-microservices

This project/repo was adapted from Nicholas Jackson tutorial (Building Microservices with Go) that can be found at:
- youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmD8u-IFdreyh6EUfevBcbiuCKzFk0EW_
- github: https://github.com/nicholasjackson/building-microservices-youtube

The small and unsignifican modification from me is implementation of mysql database instead of local storage (map)

Thank you Nick Jakson for your great and useful totorial...
